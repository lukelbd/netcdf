This tutorial reviews the common file formats used to store geophysical data (NetCDF,
HDF, GRIB) and the most commonly used tools for processing these files, along with
simple examples to illustrate their relative differences.

To play with the examples yourself, click the above "Launch Binder" link.
The [binder launcher](https://mybinder.org) may
take a few minutes to set up the conda environment specified in [environment.yml](environment.yml).
